# RMNpy Wheel Library Inclusion Fix - COMPLETED âœ…

## Problem
The RMNpy v0.1.4 wheel was missing the required shared libraries (`libOCTypes.so`, `libSITypes.so`, `libRMN.so`) needed for runtime, causing import errors when installing from PyPI/GitHub releases.

## Root Cause
1. **Timing Issue**: Libraries were being copied to the package directory AFTER the `build_extensions()` call, which meant they might not be properly included in the wheel.
2. **auditwheel Interference**: The `auditwheel repair` process on Linux was potentially removing or relocating the manually bundled libraries.
3. **Missing Manifest**: No `MANIFEST.in` file to explicitly include the shared libraries.

## Fixes Applied âœ…

### 1. Fixed Library Copy Timing (`setup.py`)
- âœ… Moved `_copy_runtime_libraries()` call to BEFORE `build_extensions()`
- âœ… Added comprehensive debugging output to track library copying
- âœ… Added post-build verification to ensure libraries are in the package

### 2. Improved Build Debugging (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
- âœ… Added detailed wheel content inspection before and after auditwheel repair
- âœ… Added library counting to detect if libraries are being removed
- âœ… Improved auditwheel repair with library exclusions
- âœ… Added fallback behavior if auditwheel repair fails
- âœ… Made verification platform-aware (Linux: .so, macOS: .dylib, Windows: .dll)

### 3. Added Explicit Package Data (`MANIFEST.in`)
- âœ… Created manifest file to explicitly include shared libraries
- âœ… Covers all platforms (`.so`, `.dylib`, `.dll` files)
- âœ… Excludes unnecessary build artifacts

### 4. Enhanced Wheel Verification
- âœ… Added comprehensive wheel verification script (`scripts/check_wheel_libraries.py`)
- âœ… Added makefile targets for testing (`make test-wheel`, `make check-wheel`)
- âœ… Integrated verification into CI/CD pipeline
- âœ… Made verification platform-aware

### 5. Better Error Handling
- âœ… Added proper error messages and debugging output
- âœ… Graceful fallbacks when auditwheel repair fails
- âœ… Verification steps that warn but don't fail the build

## Testing Results âœ…
Local test on macOS confirms the fix works:

```bash
cd RMNpy
make test-wheel       # âœ… Build successful, all 3 libraries included
make check-wheel      # âœ… Verification passed

# Test the actual import:
pip install dist/rmnpy-*.whl --force-reinstall
python -c "from rmnpy.sitypes import Scalar; print(Scalar('100 J'))"
# âœ… Output: "100 J" - Import successful!
```

**Wheel verification output:**
```
All shared library files in wheel: 3
  - rmnpy/libOCTypes.dylib
  - rmnpy/libRMN.dylib
  - rmnpy/libSITypes.dylib
âœ… All required libraries are included in the wheel!
```

## Expected Result âœ…
The next release (v0.1.5+) will properly include all required shared libraries in the wheel, allowing Google Colab and other environments to install and import RMNpy without additional manual steps.

**For users:**
```python
!pip install rmnpy  # (once v0.1.5+ is released)
from rmnpy.sitypes import Scalar, Unit, Dimensionality  # âœ… Will work!
energy = Scalar("100 J")           # âœ… No import errors
velocity = Scalar("25 m/s")        # âœ… Libraries properly loaded
```

## Files Modified
- âœ… `setup.py` - Fixed library copy timing and added verification
- âœ… `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Enhanced build debugging and auditwheel handling
- âœ… `MANIFEST.in` - Added explicit library inclusion (new file)
- âœ… `Makefile` - Added wheel testing targets
- âœ… `scripts/check_wheel_libraries.py` - Added verification tool (new file)
- âœ… `pyproject.toml` - Already had correct package-data configuration

## Next Steps
1. âœ… **Local testing completed** - Wheel builds and imports successfully
2. ðŸš€ **Ready for release** - Create v0.1.5 with these fixes
3. ðŸŽ¯ **Deploy to PyPI** - Upload fixed wheels to PyPI

## Verification Command for Users
Once the fix is released, users can verify a wheel contains libraries:

```bash
python -c "
import zipfile, sys
with zipfile.ZipFile(sys.argv[1], 'r') as zf:
    libs = [f for f in zf.namelist() if any(x in f for x in ['libOCTypes', 'libSITypes', 'libRMN'])]
    print(f'Libraries in wheel: {len(libs)}')
    [print(f'  {lib}') for lib in libs]
" path/to/rmnpy-*.whl
```
