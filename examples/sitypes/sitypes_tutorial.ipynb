    "# SITypes: Scientific Units and Dimensional Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Physical quantities require both a numerical value and a unit. For example, measuring time during a race, temperature in a patient's mouth, or mass of cheese all need units to be meaningful. Physical quantities can be scalars, vectors, matrices, or higher-dimensional objects, and with units, they acquire additional mathematical behaviors that numerical values alone lack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Units enforce dimensional consistency: quantities can only be converted between units of the same dimensionality, added/subtracted only when dimensionally compatible, and transcendental functions require dimensionless arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Physical quantities relate through physical laws, leading to Joseph Fourier's insight in 1822 that all quantities can be derived from a smaller set of fundamental reference quantities. While theoretically this could be reduced to just Planck length and speed of light, practically seven fundamental SI quantities are used: (1) length, (2) mass, (3) time, (4) electric current, (5) thermodynamic temperature, (6) amount of substance, and (7) luminous intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About SITypes\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates SITypes through RMNpy, a Python library implementing these fundamental concepts. SITypes provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creating and manipulating scientific units\n",
    "- Working with scalars (values with units)  \n",
    "- Dimensional analysis and validation\n",
    "- Unit conversions\n",
    "- Complex calculations with automatic unit tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "The examples below show how SITypes enforces mathematical rules governing physical quantities, preventing common errors while maintaining full expressiveness for complex physics and engineering problems."

    "SITypes provides three fundamental classes for working with physical quantities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dimensionality** - Represents the dimensional structure of physical quantities (e.g., Length, Mass, Time)\n",
    "2. **Unit** - Represents specific units of measurement (e.g., meters, kilograms, seconds)  \n",
    "3. **Scalar** - Represents values with units, combining numerical values with their units\n",

    "We'll explore each of these in order, building up from fundamental concepts to practical applications."

    "Inherent in measuring any physical quantity is a comparison to a previous measurement. What is most useful is the ratio of the new measurement to a previous measurement. For example, an ancient scientist might have used the cubit, an ancient unit of length, to measure the ratio of a large tree trunk's circumference to its diameter. Around 3000 BC in Egypt, a cubit was decreed to be the length of a forearm and hand. So, a scientist could make a string of 1 cubit in length using the distance from the back of their elbow to the tip of their middle finger and then use the string to measure the ratio:\n",
